# Supplementary code

## Information
This repository Contains javascript and python code for replicating analysis in "Exploring machine learning techniques to predict deforestation to enhance the decision‐making of road construction projects" [(Larrea-Gallegos and Vazquez-Rowe, 2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jiec.13185).

## Instructions
For running data processing, random forest model training and visualization:  
- To run .js scripts it is required to have a Google Earth Engine account [ [link] ](https://code.earthengine.google.com/). 
- Copy the code in the programming panel and run.
For training and prediction of Neural Network models: 
- Jupyter notebooks contain the steps and procedures of the whole experimentation, import the repository in a google Colab session [ [link] ](https://colab.research.google.com/) to avoid dependancy issues.
- A Google Drive verification step is requiered for exporting and downloading.
